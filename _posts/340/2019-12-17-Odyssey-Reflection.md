At the beginning of this course, my team and I were tasked with creating a website that would help enhance sharing and analyzing data in the Hendrix community. Our assignment was to create a site that automates the learning domain student assessment process. For this project, we had to work with Dr. Leonard and Dr. Pfau, as they oversee Learning Domain assessment analysis. Our community partners guided us through the current tedious process, and we established goals for our website. A recurrent theme in our meetings was reassessing goals and narrowing down specifics with Learning Domain Assessment. These meetings were crucial as they enabled us to show our progress to the client so that they can confirm if our vision for the website was matching theirs. Clear communication is essential for a community project like this, especially when dealing with programming as there is often a disconnect between vision and implementation. Thankfully, we were able to communicate well with our partners and meet most of their expectations.

Another interesting aspect of working on this project was working on such a large team. With that came a lot of conflicting ideas about how to solve different issues. Open discussion with the entire team was helpful in these circumstances to gauge what solutions the team was most comfortable with. At times, it can be difficult to make everyone happy especially when someoneâ€™s idea is not ultimately used; however, giving everyone the opportunity to make the case for their solution made our meetings a fair and safe environment to express ideas.

I am proud of the work we accomplished as we met nearly all the goals our clients had set for us. I feel that our website could be used to change the way assessments are done at Hendrix. I enjoyed working on this project with this team, and I hope the project can be put up on a server soon.
