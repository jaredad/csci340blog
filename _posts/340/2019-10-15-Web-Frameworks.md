Each framework offers its own merits for various projects. Here are my thoughts as these frameworks pertain to our project:

* Ruby On Rails: This could be a good tool to use; however, its highly abstracted and there are some specific things we want to achieve with our project that may be harder to do in this framework.

* ASP.Net: I like this framework because it is fairly reliable and has a good community behind it to help with any issues that could come about. I am only reticent from hearing first hand by people I trust that it was a nightmare for them.

* Laravel: I like this option although I am reticent to learn PHP. It has a lot of upsides when it comes to ease of use and I like how websites could easily be scaled with this framework.

* Flask: I'm not thrilled by this framework, I would rather go with django if I'm gonna use python because it's a more used framework and has more documentation within the django community.

* Express: I feel like I'd have to get out of my comfort zone to understand how to use this framework. Based on how it was described to me it doesn't seem like something I can easily pick up and begin, rather I'd have to learn a lot before starting.
