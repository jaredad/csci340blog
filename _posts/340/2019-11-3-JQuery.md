This project, while time consuming and stressful at many parts, was very fun and challenging. The reason I think it was so frustrating at first was because I didn't find the Kahn Academy tutorial to be very helpful with the things I had issues with. Accessing information from the APIs was the most confusing part; however, I discovered my issue was coming from the fact that there are certain websites you cannot just access information without special permission. I had to find APIs that were less difficult to access. Once I got two APIs to work for me, I was able to create a website that users can vote on random cats and dogs. Once the user gives either dogs or cats enough likes they are given an alert to go to the pages dedicated to their preferred animal.
