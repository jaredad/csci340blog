I found this lab to be the most difficult we have had thus far, and I'm glad to be finished with it. It was neat to see the end result of having a new theme for my jekyll blog. I have never worked with Jekyll blogs so everything about this lab was new to me. I'm looking forward to seeing what more we will do with the blogs. Here are a few links that I used for this project:

* [Overriding jekyll default theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults)
